# Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple simulation of tic-tac-toe made using Python. 
The program follows the standard rules of the game and
is set up so that the user always goes first
against the computer. The code is inspired by 
Python with Tim's "Learn how to create Tic Tac Toe 
in python using a simple AI" tutorial.
